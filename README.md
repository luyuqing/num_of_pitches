# num_of_pitches

A personal request from an offshore engineer. <br />
<br />
16860 meters of pipelines are going to be installed, each pipeline is of length 18.1 meter. Pitches are going to be installed to support pipelines, however, each two pipelines have some welding range under which pitches cannot be installed for support. Question is how many pitches are needed.
